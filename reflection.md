- Tell me about your class! What does it represent?
My class represents a garden. The garden has a name, a gardener, flowers, and weeds. You can also set the size of the garden. Through the different methods you're allowed to do a number of things, from adding items to a wicker basket and removing weeds from your garden to completely destroying the garden :(. It's a fairly simple class, but some of the methods implement a random feature which is always fun.
- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?
I did not implement any additional methods.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I believe the hardest thing for me was deciding what my class should do. The methods in the interface all looked really promising, but I think that made me overcomplicate my ideas. Ultimately, I ended up deciding on something I knew I could complete and would have fun doing. Some advice I would give to someone taking this course in the future is to reference the lecture slides, google, and also past assignements! For this task, I looked at a lot of my old code to help me out, specifcally with the random feature.
